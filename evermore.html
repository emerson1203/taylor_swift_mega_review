            I hear this is the forgotten album. I'm curious to see how it compares to 
            folklore for me. But I think one of two things will happen. Either I will 
            like it WAY more, or a little less.

            <b>willow - 8/10 </b> <br> THATS MY WIFE! I love the music of this one and 
              I don’t really pay attention to the lyrics. But I see this as her trynna 
              figure him out and that’s my favorite thing to do.  
              <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>champagne problems - 7/10 </b> <br> it’s me… hi… I’m the problem… it’s 
            me… that’s what this song is. I’m thinking he proposed and had everyone in 
            on it to celebrate but then she said no and walked away.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>gold rush - 6/10 </b> <br> Rose and Jack vibes. Yeah this one’s ok for me.   <br>

          </p>
            <b> <span style="color: #000000 "><a href="christmas.html" style="font-size:20px">'tis the damn season - 8/10</a></span></b><br> 
            So just... vibe with ur high school bf for a week at Christmas? And reminisce 
            about how you should've stayed together? Alright. It's a vibe. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>tolerate it - 9/10 </b> <br> Yiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiikes. John vibes.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>no body, no crime - 10/10 </b> <br> This is already one of my favorite 
            songs out of folklore and evermore. I love murder. I’m a vengeful spirit.  <br>
 
          </p>
        <p>
            <b>happiness - 3/10 </b> <br> Ok sorry I hate this song. Can’t really explain 
          why. But I think the message is dumb as heck. But *ding* midnights reference.  <br>
 
          </p>
        <p>
            <b>dorothea - 7/10 </b> <br> This one was sweet. If not a bit clingy. Reminds 
          me of a short story I read once tho.   <br>

          </p>
        <p>
            <b>coney island - 8/10 </b> <br> Ok this first and foremost reminds me of an 
          episode of Dora the Explorer that might’ve never existed because I remember it 
          clear as day but no one else seems to. But anyway on with the song. I see this 
          as like a mom growing apart from her kid more than anything else. It’s nice I 
          suppose.  <br>

          </p>
        <p>
            <b>ivy - 7/10 </b> <br> In doing research for my… research paper… I read a… 
          paper that had a very detailed analysis of this song. And I do really like the 
          sound of it, that’s for sure. But to be honest I felt like the lyrics could’ve 
          been a little stronger.   <br>

          </p>
        <p>
            <b>cowboy like me - 8/10 </b> <br> The paper also had an analysis of this song. 
          Enemies to lovers to enemies vibes. I kinda like this one though, it’s funky. THIS 
          is a story that has not been done before.   <br>

          </p>
        <p>
            <b>long story short - 9/10 </b> <br> 
          Immediately I like that this song is boppy. Yeah I like this one. I also quote this 
          song regularly.   <br>

          </p>
        <p>
            <b>marjorie - 8/10 </b> <br> Aw this one’s kinda sad. Makes me think of an elderly 
          couple, or newlyweds. But also it’s super repetitive.   <br>

          </p>
        <p>
            <b>closure - 7/10 </b> <br> Oh I like that beginning. Wait ok that was weird. Call 
          me crazy but she is singing this in a British accent. But also I truly have no idea 
          what’s happening in the audio. Is it supposed to represent her internal conflict? Idk 
          but it’s distracting. Overall for the lyrics it seems like the type of song she’s done 
          many times before.   <br>

          </p>
        <p>
            <b>evermore - 7/10 </b> <br> I don’t know how to explain it but this song feels like 
          Speak Now. I like the echoey effect just before the last bit. Gonna be honest I don’t 
          really understand this song. But I do like the sound of it.   <br>

          </p>
        <p>
            <b>right where you left me - bonus track - 8/10 </b> <br> This reminds me of… Stand 
          Up Guy, but less irritating. But I like that it’s fun, and there’s some southern in it. 
          Hmmmmm 23 eh? Also reminds me of the not-proposal in Legally Blonde. But sorry when she 
          says “help” that’s kinda funny.   <br>

          </p>
        <p>
            <b>it's time to go - bonus track - 7/10 </b> <br> We love the divorce after a long 
          marriage. I actually really like the message of this one. But there’s nothing particularly 
          exciting going on musically.   <br>
