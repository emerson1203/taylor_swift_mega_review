            Ok so I already know I enjoy lover. Like. It’s so fun. But I also think this is where we hit a point 
            where I’ll start to recognize less songs because Lover has no nostalgia.

            <b>I Forgot That You Existed - 10/10</b> <br> I loooove 
            this song. I envied this song for a very long time (yes that seems weird written down), and this song 
            would make me mildly upset. But… I can relate to this song now. And I love it now. It’s like you can 
            hear her smiling in it.   
            <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Cruel Summer - 9/10  </b> <br> I specifically love 
            “devils roll the dice angels roll their eyes.” The rest of the song confuses me and I can’t seem to 
            really interpret it but I just like that line. And like the general vibe of the song whatever that may 
            be.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Lover - 8/10 </b> <br> I mean, it's a cute song. It's a
            really cute song. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Man - 8/10 </b> <br> Ok I mean I like this song. Like I SING to this. But the music video gives 
            me this creepy uncanny valley feeling and I can’t FULLY shake that feeling when listening to the song.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Archer - 7/10 </b> <br> This is sad. Yeah. It’s just… depressing. A complete lack of trust. But 
            also this song is very relaxing lol.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>I Think He Knows - 8/10 </b> <br> I feel like the lyrics aren’t the deepest thing every but this song 
            is one of those fun ones. Makes me wanna go for a walk. I love the layers at the end.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Miss Americana And The Heartbreak Prince - 7/10 </b> <br> Another high school vibe. Just such a high 
            school movie. Also I love the phrase “you play stupid games you win stupid prizes”   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Paper Rings - 10/10  </b> <br> This one is just so happy. 
            Like yes I’m a very particular person and I think everything should always be done the exact right way 
            which is MY way BUT when I’m with people I care about genuinely having a good time all that- most of that 
            goes out the window.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Cornelia Street - 5/10 </b> <br> Personally this song just makes me thing of Myrtle Avenue which is a 
            song I like a lot more. I don’t know why but I’ve just never liked this song.  <br>
 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Death By A Thousand Cuts - 9/10 </b> <br> Oh that is an interesting intro. The lyrics aren’t really 
            doing it for me- oh I kinda like that bit about- ok as soon as I write that the lyrics get good. I like 
            the whole back and forth feeling.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>London Boy - 7/10 </b> <br> This song is cute. Like. Dorky. It’s dorky. But it’s cute. All the silly 
            britishism (yes that’s a word).   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Soon You'll Get Better - </b> <br> I will also not be rating this song.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>False God - 9/10 </b> <br> ok let’s be real we all know what this song is about. And we like it for 
            that. But it’s also a bit slow.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>You Need To Calm Down - 7/10 </b> <br> Ok this song is fun on the radio and stuff but I’d really never 
            put it on a playlist. Like it’s fun an all but it’s one of those… one time songs you want for the message 
            but it’s not like… very… repeatable. If that makes any sense.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Afterglow - 5/10 </b> <br> This song literally makes me feel nothing at all. And it’s low key boring.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>ME! - 6/10 </b> <br> Brendon Urie •_• I mean this song is like FUN but it’s a little TOO silly to be 
            a fun song. Also I can’t believe they took out “hey kids! Spelling is fun!” That was my favorite part.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>It's Nice To Have A Friend - 7/10 </b> <br> This reminds me of Asking For A Friend. Why does it sound 
            like she’s just friendzoning this clearly romantic relationship— But also the instrumentals are so calming… 
            the like echoey brass  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Daylight - 9/10 </b> <br> Every time I see this song I think about Harry Style’s Daylight. Someone should 
            do a mashup of them. Also this is like the song that… catapults into midnights. I mean I like this oneee and 
            I like the color references and all.   <br>
