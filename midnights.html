          <p>
            This is the one I’ve been waiting for. Originally I started this process with the intention 
            of finishing evermore when Midnights came out, obviously that didn’t happen. But still, I haven’t 
            added any midnights songs to my main playlist yet because I’ve been waiting to do it here. Though I’ve 
            listened through this album many times, which is different than any other album here, this is the first 
            time I’m actually reading the lyrics. Very excited, so let’s get on with the show.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Lavender Haze - 8/10 </b> <br> I have never noticed the 
            weird honking noise in the background. I like how this song starts off on the subtle message throughout 
            the album that Taylor Swift wants everyone to stop asking her if she is married / is getting married. I 
            love how she says “get it off my desk” don’t know why that line speaks to me so much. Also fully thought 
            she was saying “talkin shit and go viral.”   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Maroon - 7/10  </b> <br> Ok it’s suddenly hit me that this 
            song reminds me of Perfect by 1D. At least the first half does. I’ve always thought at the end when she says 
            “it was maroon” sounds like it’s… in reverse? But this is not one of my top Midnights songs. <br>
  
          </p>
          <p><b> <span style="color: #000000 "><a href="antihero.html" style="font-size:20px">Anti-Hero - 7/10</a></span></b><br> 
            My favorite part about this song is that I’ve personally witnessed people falling victim to her saying she’s 
            “the problem”. Acting so smug like she didn’t do that on purpose. My favorite part is the part about the will. 
            I know she’s doing a snake thing at the “everybody agrees” but it literally makes me wanna throw up.<br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Snow On The Beach - 7/10 </b> <br> My favorite part is the bit about Janet, though I don’t know what it’s 
            referencing, I like the vocal effect. Overall the song is pretty good but again it’s not one of my favorites. <br>
  
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>You're On Your Own Kid - 7/10 </b> <br> Ok this song, I do like even though other people seem to not. It’s like… 
            trust issues the musical. I don’t really have much else to say about it tho.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Midnight Rain - 7/10 </b> <br> I wonder who this is about. This song, 
            I feel though, actually directly addresses the theme of the album at the end which is fun.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Question...? - 7/10 </b> <br> I’m imagining her harshly interrogating 
            this person, but just asking question after question not letting them get a word in, and then being like “what it’s 
            just a question I’m just curious.”   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Vigilante Shit - 9/10 </b> <br> “Don’t get sad, get even” soooo true. 
            I love the sound of the part about ladies. I really like this song, just gotta say.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Bejeweled - 7/10 </b> <br> I like that this is one of the fun ones, 
            makes ya wanna do a little dance. But it’s not one of my favorite fun ones.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Labyrinth - 8/10 </b> <br> Someone said this sounded like moaning at the beginning, but I don’t think that’s true. 
            Omg me too I am also scared of elevators. (Not really just elevator doors, the elevator itself is fine.) Literally 
            couldn’t figure out why this song was called Labyrinth until my like 10th listen because she only says it once. I like 
            the way she does the thing with the breathe and then the break. I do like that this one is sweet, but not overly so. Ya 
            know? It’s quite the refresher from a lot of her romance songs.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Karma - 8/10 </b> <br> But, karma CAN’T be your boyfriend. I like the part 
            about the acrobat. I think people say this should’ve been the big single, and I have to say I agree. But at the same time, 
            I get the message she was trying to send with making anti-hero the single, and this song probably would’ve just made people 
            more upset with her if it was heavily pushed to everyone and not just her fans. “Ask my why so many fade but I’m still here” 
            Aaron Burr vibes. Bones fly this song is such a vibe, there are so many layers to it that are just kind of a big fu to a 
            lot of people.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Sweet Nothing - 8/10 </b> <br> I didn’t like this song at first, but then when 
            I really paid attention to it, it’s really sweet. Bones fly the thought of loving the person who makes you just feel… calm… it 
            hits me so hard. Yeah I’m starting to get really attached to this song.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Mastermind - 8/10 </b> <br> Ok I do like the story of this song, YOYOK was trust 
            issues the musical, and this is overthinking the musical. “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail” truer words have never been 
            spoken.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Great War - 7/10 </b> <br> Ok I really like the sound of this one, but I kinda think the lyrics are… idk (and I know a 
            lot of people like this one •_•) I gotta admit the song just confuses me, because it feels like it’s going one way, and then does 
            a full turnaround. I guess I like the second half, but the first half just doesn’t… fit. <br>
 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Bigger Than The Whole Sky </b> <br> I also feel like I shouldn’t rate this song because of what we all assume the meaning to be. 
            “Did some force take you because I didn’t pray?” Is like the most heart wrenching line.   
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Paris - 9/10 </b> <br> OOOOOKAY this is one of my favorites. It’s the best dance-y 
            one. “Sit quiet by my side in the shade, and not the kind that’s thrown, I mean the kind under where a tree has grown” girl HUH 
            that’s so funny. “Swooping sloping cursive letters” is so satisfying.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>High Infidelity - 7/10 </b> <br> Everyone going crazy right after this to figure out where she was on April 29th. Man I just 
            don’t know about this song. It makes me feel… emotionally itchy. But I like the sound of it, the sort of bubbly noise in the 
            background.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Glitch - 10/10 </b> <br> THIS SONG IS MY FAVORITE MIDNIGHTS SONG. It’s so good with 
            headphones on, that layered sound. It feels like the sci-fi of music. The way that 2190 days is exactly 6 years and it’s like 
            “I’ve never been with someone this long what’s happening” and it makes me want to explode. “Blood moonlit” like the blood moon 
            record, eh eh?   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Would've, Could've, Should've - 10/10 </b> <br> This song makes me want to scream 
            my heart out which I don’t think I’ve said that since I did Fearless and Speak Now. “Give me back my girlhood, it was mine 
            first.” LoooooOOOrd.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Dear Reader - 7/10 </b> <br> Ya know I don’t know if I vibe with being spoken to directly like this. But I mean… it’s all decent 
            advice. Reminds me of “Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young” which is a speech and not a song and yet it very 
            occasionally plays on the radio for some reason. Ok why did I never notice what happens with the vocals at the end of this song. 
            I’m suspicious that I missed something and the end of the song indicates that it was all bad advice which doesn’t exactly bode 
            well for me but whatever.   <br>
