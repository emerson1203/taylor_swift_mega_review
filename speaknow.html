          <p>
            Speak Now is the album I forget most. It's just very similar to Fearless in my mind, so I kind of group
            them together as the same thing.

          <p>
            <b>Mine - 6/10</b> <br> A solid song, nothin special. I like the whole... parental failure undertones. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Sparks Fly - 7/10</b> <br> Funny, just the other day, we were walking into the grocery store, and it
            started to rain, and I went, "DROP EVERYTHING NOW" then said nothing else, without even knowing what song
            I was singing. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Back to December - 7/10</b> <br> This seems like a high school love that in hindsight is silly but at
            the moment seems like absoluetly everything. Cuz it seems like it lasted like... 5 months. Yl.9ou break up
            in the heat of the moment because you're not old enough to realize that conflict doesn't mean the end of
            a relationship. But ya know, ya live and learn and move on... eventually. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Speak Now - 5/10</b> <br> This is the song I was waiting for. However, I remember it being... more 
            intense than this. Would be looking forward to a Taylor's Version of this song specifically, because I think
            she could do a lot more with it. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Dear John - 8/10</b> <br> It's a solid song. Like she wants to be louder, but she's tired, this is all
            the anger she can manage. But that makes it all the better. I think this song deserves an f-bomb somewhere.<br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Mean - 9/10 </b> <br> SOMEDAY I'LL BE LIVIN IN A BIG OLD CITY
            AND ALL YOU'RE EVER GONNA BE IS MEAN- classic throwback. Ain't nothin to say, this song is great.<br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Story of Us - 8/10 </b> <br> This is ALSO a fantastic 
            throwback. Lyrics are fine but who cares it's a nostalgic- OH THAT ENDING WAS FUNNY. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Never Grow Up - 9/10</b> <br> Absoluetly no right to stab me in the feels like this. Shut up. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Enchanted - 9/10 </b> <br> Throwback~~~ also I like this one.
            I am picturing the sparkling champagne attire, neither of you want to be there, but you both have to, for
            whatever reason. Unimportant. And you see each other, and it's a good night, and at the end you think, we'll
            never meet again. Oh but you do, later in the plot. Just when you've almost forgotten about the whole thing.
            It ends with a proposal, in the same champagne attire you were wearing when you first met. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Better Than Revenge - 10/10 </b> <br> Enemies to lovers vibes.
            Nah cuz she seems cool. Sorry you weren't fast enough Taylor. It ain't like she forces this guy to date her.
            It is how it is. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Innocent - 9/10</b> <br> :(  32 makes me wonder... who she's talking to though. I mean SHE'S only just
            now 32, present day. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Haunted - 8/10 </b> <br> Now I love this song. Super Bowl intro
            gets you pumped up kinda deal. I love the rhythm of this one. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Last Kiss - 5/10</b> <br> Meh. This is boring. Especially after the last 4 songs.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Long Live - 8/10 </b> <br> This is very... American high school
            experience... but the good parts... not the parts where we're murdered. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Ours - 6/10</b> <br> It's sweet, but it's nothing special.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>If This Was A Movie - 4/10</b> <br> Based on just the title, I should like this song. Let's see.    Oh.
            It's this song. Meh. It's ok.    Ok I have to be honest I don't like this song. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Superman - 6/10</b> <br> Omg Reputation. Anyways. I genuinely do not know how to feel about this song. 
            Can't seem to puzzle it out. I keep starting to form a story and then the next verse comes along and it
            falls apart. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Back To December (Acoustic) - 8/10</b> <br> This actually enhances my previous theory. This isn't some
            celebrity romance. This is a high schooler with a guitar putting her feelings out there in some way, 
            because that's all most of us want to do when we're upset. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Haunted (Acoustic) - 8/10</b> <br> Bestie missing that Super Bowl intro. Ohhh there it is, just further in.
            Not as intense though. But I think her voice is stronger in this one. So it evens out. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Mine (POP Mix) - 7/10</b> <br> Same deal as the original except way more fun.  <br>
