            I’ll be honest, I’ve been putting off this and evermore. But at the same time 
            I really want to get to Midnights. I dunno. This seems like a 1 time listen kind 
            of album. Like how movie soundtracks are good but you rarely put them on a playlist. 
            But maybe I will be proven wrong.

            <b>the 1 - 6/10 </b> <br> Ok she’s fun. Wrong place wrong time sort of story? I dunno 
            I was expecting it to hit harder.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>cardigan - 6/10 </b> <br> This happens a lot for me with Taylor swift songs, but 
            I’m always so onboard with the sharp decline ready for a tragic ending and then at the 
            very end all of a sudden HE COMES BACK. Regardless of if that’s actually what happened 
            or if it’s like she’s saying she knows but really she doesn’t and he never comes back. 
            If it’s the second one I’m on board. But I like the metaphors.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>the last great american dynasty - 7/10 </b> <br> This house is definitely haunted in 
            a good way with the spirit of a ghost lady from like hundreds of years ago who was super 
            tired of everyone’s shit so she fills the house with the spirit of 
            “I-don’t-give-a-heck-and-I’ll-do-what-I-want”  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>exile - 7/10 </b> <br> Wow both these people suck. Yeah this song just flat out annoys 
            me. But it is a good song, like, musically. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>my tears ricochet - 5/10 </b> <br> Lol the stolen tracks. This very vaguely, mostly at 
            the end, sounds like Midnight Rain. Also I’m super confused about this entire song, and 
            it’s not very… much… of… anything… at all. I think her death is a metaphor but that’s all I got. <br>
  
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>mirrorball - 8/10 </b> <br> Ok this one makes me… feel things. It feels… a little personal.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>seven - 8/10 </b> <br> Human beings man. You can be so young but feel so much even if you can’t 
            put words to it, and you fill in missing pieces with make believe, you remember it forever. I felt 
            so deeply heartbroken over even the most minor injustices as a kid.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>august - 6/10 </b> <br> Eh. Classic summer love story. Been done. Seen that.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>this is me trying - 8/10 </b> <br> The chorus reminds me of back to December. Gifted burnout vibes.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>illicit affairs - 7/10 </b> <br> …ok. I like the sound of the song. But I feel like the lyrics are 
            a little TOO straightforward.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>invisible string - 9/10 </b> <br> Just did a literary analysis on this song for a final, now it’s 
            time to actually listen to it. But I do love this song because this is exactly how I think. And y’all 
            KNOW I like my color term lyrics.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>mad woman - 10/10 </b> <br> “It’s obvious that wanting 
            me dead has really brought you two together” sorta pushed this song over the edge for me. Also I like 
            the play on mad angry woman and mad crazy woman.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>epiphany - 8/10 </b> <br> Ok- this is different from the get go. Tbh this is the first song where 
            I’m like this is a S T O R Y. It’s like battlefield nurse vibes.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>betty - 7/10 </b> <br> This is the song I remember most from this album the first time I did this. 
            Isn’t his name James? Idk. Doesn’t matter. It’s like this whole see it from the antagonists perspective 
            but NO it doesn’t make it better, it makes it worse, he’s so pathetic. What so Betty hangs out with some 
            guy at a party one time and your whiny baby self sleeps with another girl over it? That justifies nothing. 
            WHY DOES SHE TAKE HIM BA- stupid.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>peace - 4/10 </b> <br> Almost every HALF a lyric in this song reminds me of a different thing. Idk this 
            song is kind of a bummer and a half. There is nothing about this song that she hasn’t said in dozens of 
            other songs. And it’s like boring musically and lyrically.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>hoax - 7/10 </b> <br> This one’s pretty good. I think I have a vague sense of what the message is supposed 
            to be. But I’m not like emotionally moved or anything.   <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>the lakes - bonus track - 8/10 </b> <br> I like this song. It reminds me of Ivy in Eden. It’s like peaceful 
            in a chaotic way.   <br>
