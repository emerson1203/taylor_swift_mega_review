          <p>
            This album is very different from all the others, and it has some great ones, but a lot of it is a little boring.

            <b>Tim McGraw - 6/10 </b> <br> It's a good song, but it doesn't make me feel any particular way. 
            I like that it mentions Georgia (stars) though. <br>
          
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Picture to Burn - 10/10 </b> <br> Reminds me of once upon a time when I went crazy with a pair
            of scissors (there would have been fire involved if I wasn't afraid of fire) and a bunch of stupid notes
            and drawings. Also so true, pick up trucks are stupid. Sad break up songs are bummers but this song
            is IT. <br>
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Teardrops on My Guitar - 4/10</b> <br> Sorry but I've never liked this song. It's kinda... boring. And I
            don't get it. And I'm picturing literal teardrops on a guitar and it makes me uncomfortable. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A Place in This World - 8/10</b> <br> Barbie vibes are STRONG and this makes it good by default. I can see
            her now, spinning in the streets singing after she's just been fired from her role in Princess in the Pea, and
            then she is no longer on her own because she immediately goes to live with her aunt in ~Paris~. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Cold as You - 7/10 </b> <br> It's calm, and just listening to
            it I don't feel much, the vocals are nothing spectacular. Except that one line. But reading through the lyrics
            kinda brings it through, these are some FEELY lyrics. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Outside - 5/10</b> <br> IM ON THE OUTSIDE ALWAYS LOOKING IN WILL I BE MORE THAN IVE ALWAYS BEEN. Average.
            Kinda feely, but mostly not. Overall average. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Tied Together With a Smile - 7/10</b> <br> These are some fun vocals. Reminds me of Tinkerbell movies. Not
            much to say about this one, it's just a fun listen. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Stay Beautiful - 5/10</b> <br> I have... nothing to say about this song. This sounds like a fake song from
            a TV show. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Should've Said No - 8/10</b> <br> Say No To This from Eliza's perspective lol. This one's a fun one. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Mary's Song (Oh My My My) - 9/10</b> <br> :)<br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Our Song - 7/10</b> <br> It's a fun one, but I think it's a tad overrated. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>I'm Only Me When I'm With You - 6/10</b> <br> Most of it is sweet, but specifically "I'm only me when I'm
            with you" bothers me, which is unfortunate because that's the title. But this is nothing... unique. This whole
            ... sentiment, it's been done plenty of times before. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Invisible - 4/10</b> <br> This is… a very boring song. And I don’t like the… story? Message? This just ain’t
            the song for me.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A Perfectly Good Heart - 6/10</b> <br> It's a decent song, but it's not making me... feel anything. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Teardrops On My Guitar - Pop Version - 4/10</b> <br> Sorry this sounds the exact same as the original version. 
            How is this a pop version?  <br>
