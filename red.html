            Now this is a big one. Like it's just a massive album, and I already know a lot of the songs. I kind of
            struggle to form good feedback when I already know the song really well.

          <p>
            <b>State of Grace (TV) - 8/10</b> <br> She's got a long intro. Dang not even, no words to say. This is just
            a good song. All the metaphors and whatnot. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Red (TV) - 7/10</b> <br> I mean this song is a classic, ya know. Lots of... what's the word... not 
            metaphor... I can't think of the word. But there's lots of it. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Treacherous (TV) - 8/10</b> <br> Bruh... idk... this song has like... maybe it's just me but this song...
            has very strong... sexual? undertones. Like... idek how to describe it. Maybe I'm reading this wrong and
            being weird. But like. Idk. Like. Yeah like. yeah. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>I Knew You Were Trouble (TV) - 9/10 </b> <br> Ultimate 
            throwback. Love this song. I love the gritty way the "trouble" is after the "oh oh"'s.<br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>All Too Well (TV) - 9/10</b> <br> Oh boy. "So casually cruel in the name of being honest." That's it. 
            That's all I got for this one. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>22 (TV) - 10/10  </b> <br> ULTIMATE throwback. Reminds me
            of my friends cuz of New Years :)<br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>I Almost Do (TV) - 6/10</b> <br> This song is ok. I sorta feel the feelings, but mostly not. It's kinda
            relaxing though. And I like the way she says "I bet". <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (TV) - 7/10</b> <br> Another throwback, but girly, this one sounds
            SO different from the original. And it's almost... like to a point where it doesn't feel like a throwback. 
            HOWEVER this song is Taylor Swift on a roller coaster which is my favorite thing ever. Yeah, no, the more
            I listen the more it's too different. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Stay Stay Stay (TV) - 10/10 </b> <br> The intro sounds like
            royalty free YouTube music. Ok I can't lie. This one genuinely makes me smile. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Last Time (TV) - 6/10</b> <br> Ok that guy introing threw me off. Ya this one... kinda boring. But
            I really like his voice. This actually sounds like a Snow Patrol song featuring Taylor Swift.
            <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Holy Ground (TV) - 6/10</b> <br> I like the tempo. I just like this song. It's... peaceful.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Sad Beautiful Tragic (TV) - 5/10</b> <br> Why does this intro sound like medieval town music. This sounds
            like Taylor Swift if she was from the 1920's. But yeah logically this sound sounds impressive but it's just
            not... hitting me. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Lucky One (TV) - 8/10</b> <br> I'm sure this is about someone specific. But I don't know who. But it's
            reminding me of Jeanette McCurdy. Though she was most definetly not from the 60's. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Everything Has Changed (TV) - 7/10</b> <br> Wait this is more of a throwback than I realized. But just like
            WANEGBT, it's too different and doesn't feel like a throwback anymore. But "I just wanna know you better now..."
            that bit? SOOOO nostalgic. "Everything has changed" that bit? Less so. WAIT that group bit? Thaaaat's good. That
            alone earns this another point. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Starlight (TV) - 9/10 </b> <br> Oooooookayyyyyy I like this
            oneeeeee. It's funnnnnnnnn. "To the nines" I love that phrase it doesn't make any sense. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Begin Again (TV) - 10/10 </b> <br> Shut up. Stop. No.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Moment I Knew (TV) - 10/10</b> <br> Ohhhhhhhh shooooot 21st birthday? Or is it- yeah it is talking about
            that. Daaaaang. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Come Back... Be Here (TV) - 7/10</b> <br> I really like the vibe of this one. Very movie like though. Omg
            LONDON boy. Ooh that bit where almost everything drops out and it's just the clappping? Good stuff. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Girl At Home (TV) - 6/10 </b> <br> Well it's kinda wild that the
            only reason she wouldn't partake in this other girl getting cheated on is cuz she's been cheated on. But 
            I like the instrumentals. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>State of Grace (Acoustic Version) (TV) - 8/10</b> <br> Tbh this is more impactful than the regular one. 
            But all the same commentary otherwise. Cuz like I still love the drummy bits. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Ronan (TV) - </b> <br> I will not be rating nor commenting on this song.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Better Man (TV) (FTV) - 6/10</b> <br> ~A butter man~ Idk this song is pretty good. A fairly... baseline
            statement I think. It's nice to listen to though. I like Butter Man better. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Nothing New (TV) (FTV) - 9/10</b> <br> Why does this song seem soooooo familiar even though I don't
            think I've listened to it that much? But daaaang I like this one. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Babe (TV) (FTV) - 7/10</b> <br> Girl this one's just FUN. I mean... the lyrics seem a little sad... but it's
            still fun. Ooooh did he cheeeeeat?? I think that's what happened. Yeah, so true, ya ain't getting through that. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Message In A Bottle (TV) (FTV) - 9/10 </b> <br> I don't care
            what anyone says, this song is fun as heck. Why make poetic lyrics when you can make a song ANYONE knows 
            EVERYONE can scream it THAT'S still also a good song. Also I dunno what's happening in the background but
            it sounds like racecars and that is funny to me. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>I Bet You Think About Me (TV) (FTV) - 7/10</b> <br> I'm sorry?? Debut?? Is that you? I dunno I can't even
            think about anything else this is so country. But I like the concept, and it's reminding me of SOOO many other
            TS songs. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Forever Winter (TV) (FTV) - 8/10</b> <br> Is. That. BRASS. Ohhh this one's kinda dark... at first it seems
            like toxic boyfriend for the sake of it but then it seems like super depressed boyfriend who isn't trying
            to be hurtful. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Run (TV) (FTV) - 6/10</b> <br> This sounds like music my mom would listen to. It ain't doin anything special. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Very First Night (TV) (FTV) - 8/10 </b> <br> This one's a
            bop. Nothing else to say. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (TV) (FTV) - 8/10</b> <br> I stand by that this song could've ended at
            7:11. Like I like the stuff she says after that, but 7:11 would've been a good ending spot. But yeah, it's
            a good song and all. <br>
