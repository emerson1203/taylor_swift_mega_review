            What's not to love about this album? It's just so... she really came back
            with a bang. Ya know? We love it. This is like the tour everyone knows. Also
            Reputation seems more cohesive than every other album. Almost to a point that
            it's a negative because every song sounds so similar. Almost.

            <b>...Ready For It? - 8/10 </b> <br> Greaaaat open to the 
            album. I do wish the base sounded a LITTLE more like base and a LITTLE less like the sound iPhones make 
            when you’re doing the “get water out of the speakers” sound. This is just. It’s a good song. Just jumping 
            straight into it.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>End Game - 5/10</b> <br> Now I do in fact make fun of the intro of this song every time it plays. And 
            I do not like this rap bit. Another “you all over me” thing? Yeahhhh sorry but… this song is just kinda… 
            goofy.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>I Did Something Bad - 9/10 </b> <br> Yeahhhh this one’s a 
            vibe. We love this one. Love it all. Especially the bit about the witches.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Don't Blame Me - 9/10 </b> <br> This one is ALSO good. I 
            don’t know why but this one feels PARTICULARLY nostalgic. Like not just “this reminds me of being with 
            friends and in the car” but something… more… than that. The Poison Ivy mention is making me thing of 
            Harley Quinn which is making this so much better.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Delicate - 6/10</b> <br> This one’s good. I mean it’s like… I remember it from before. But it’s not 
            really FUN enough to be a throwback. But it’s like overall pretty good. “You must like me for me” that’s 
            sweet :) <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Look What You Made Me Do - 8/10 </b> <br> Why does this 
            have like haunted nursery rhyme vibes? This also reminds me of Harley Quinn. I dooo have to say I never 
            liked that bit about the phone.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>So It Goes... - 7/10</b> <br> This song feels kinda all over the place but in a way I like. It’s pretty 
            good overall. I like the whole number counting bit. It’s funny.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Gorgeous - 10/10 </b> <br> This one makes me feel all the feels. 
            The smiles. Miss Georgia. But also just everything. I love this song. BUT IF YOURE SINGLE THATS HONESTLY WORSE 
            CUZ YOURE SO GORGEOUS IT ACTUALLY HURTS. I love the little drops and the twinkling sounds. The lyrics, the 
            instrumentals, it’s all so FUN. I imagine they’re at a fancy party and the *tink* noises are cheersing champagne 
            glasses.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Getaway Car - 6/10 </b> <br> I do have a specific memory with this 
            song. I’m a little tired and can’t bother to figure out quite what the song is saying. But it’s, like, fun. But 
            also kinda… depressing feeling. Idk. I gotta be honest it’s not really hitting.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>King Of My Heart - 7/10</b> <br> I mean, ok, we all get the- yeah. Ok. Yeah this one’s pretty good. I kinda 
            don’t have that much to say.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Dancing With Our Hands Tied - 8/10</b> <br> Forbidden love~ royalty with peasantry- the town is talking- the 
            queen is ~royally~ pissed- the peasant is executed- the Royal is alone once again, forever heart broken~  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Dress - 8/10 </b> <br> Ok. This one is good. We like it. Let’s be real.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things - 9/10 </b> <br> I love this song. 
            I quote this constantly because I already would say “this is why we can’t have nice things” to people all the time. 
            Just love the whole vibe.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Call It What You Want - 8/10 </b> <br> I love how this song really represents this album going from Taylor Swift 
            being a vengeful menace to just appreciating her boyfriend because he doesn’t hate her for things she didn’t really 
            do, like she feels most of the world does.  <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>New Year's Day - 6/10 </b> <br> Oh my gosh midnights reference. THREE HAND SQUEEZE I always love that. Sorry ok 
            this is like probably emotionally significant and all but I just think it’s boring tbh. I kinda like the layering 
            at the end though.   <br>
