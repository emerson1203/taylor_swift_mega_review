            This is the throwback party playlist you'd sing on the playground back then, and sing during late nights with
            your friends today. A lot of nostalgia, a lot of memories, a lot of fun. (I will not be reviewing the voice 
            memos)

            <b>Welcome To New York - 7/10</b> <br> There are a lot of 2010's pop songs about New York. This on is up there,
            but not the best. "Boys and boys and girls and girls" makes me think of boysenberry jam. And Secret Life of
            Pets kinda... well... <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Blank Space - 8/10</b> <br> Ok I mean this is a throwback and then
            some. But I never realized how fun the instrumentals were. LONG LIST OF EXLOVERS?? Ok the- the blank space bit-
            it makes sense now- ok. Let's not discuss this revelation I'm only just now having. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Style - 9/10</b> <br> Ok. I. Love. This song. Always have. Oh and
            actually reading the lyrics- IT'S BETTER. "aNd YoUr FaVoRiTe ShIrT"<br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Out Of The Woods - 7/10</b> <br> Are. We. Out. Of. The. Woods. Yet.
            Are. We. Out. Of. The. Woods. Yet. Are. We. Out. Of. The. Woods. Yet. Are. We. Out. Of. The. Woods. I actually
            really like this song but SOMEONE decided to RUIN it every time it played so now it's just a joke. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>All You Had To Do Was Stay - 7/10</b> <br> A mashup of this with Stay Stay Stay. Anyway, this is ok ig. Not
            really hitting. The ending is... a bit prolonged. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Shake It Off - 8/10</b> <br> Absolute ultimate throwback right here.
            May not be a masterpiece of a song, but, I really feel like she's just having FUN with this one. The whole "my ex
            man" bit just seems so out of place but in a way that I love. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>I Wish You Would - 6/10</b> <br> Ok idk what it is about this song but it's just BORING. But I like how she 
            says "push my buttons."<br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Bad Blood - 7/10</b> <br> It's a good throwback, but looking back on
            it now, it's still a fun song, but lyrically it's just alright. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Wildest Dreams (TV) - 8/10</b> <br> This is actually a song I have
            specific memories associated with. So I love it for that. Plus it's a good throwback. I love the... we know it 
            won't last but lets do it anyway vibe. The Taylor's Version has noticeable differences, but it's not like with Red
            where it ruins the throwback vibe. It just makes it sound more dreamlike which is exactly what a throwback should
            feel like. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>How You Get The Girl - 4/10</b> <br> Unfortunately this song is
            also associated with a specific memory so I have to add it to that playlist. And it has girl in the title. But oml
            I- this song is both funny, but also I would never listen to it on my own time partly because I can't take it 
            seriously and partly because for some reason I do NOT like this song. It feels... manipulative. Like... like
            this is a cycle he's perpetuating. This isn't a "I made one mistake and it's all ok now" it's a that's what I'm
            TELLING you but really I'm a narcissist. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>This Love (TV) - 9/10</b> <br> Oooooh the... what's it called when the
            lefta nd right earbud are slightly delayed... that... this is good I love this. OMG Wildest Dreams. Making me feel
            like I'm really sitting on the beach with these echoes. I guess I've never listened to this song with headphones before
            because I do not remember it being this... relaxing. Ya know. When the sounds are good and your brain just... stops
            for a second. And I'll be honest, I'm not really noticing a difference between the Taylor's and original version which
            is good because I really liked the original. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>I Know Places - 8/10</b> <br> I know for a fact I've mentioned that
            this song reminds me of... let me find the text... Vigilante Shit. Not in meaning but in rhythm. Also this feels 
            slower than I remember. But I've always liked this song. The other song mentions sinking ships and so does this one.
            That's fun. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Clean - 9/10</b> <br> Shi- this is like... it's You All Over Me...
            connected. But ALSO "hung my head as I lost the war" and The Great War?? Possible connection?? This song is giving
            me a feeling of such deep satisfaction. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Wonderland - 7/10</b> <br> Waiiit I was trying to find this song earlier because of I think another midnights
            thing. I don't remember what though. Ohhh ok it took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize this is an Alice
            in Wonderland reference. The whole going mad bit. Yeah anyway why does this song make me think they like did drugs
            together and legit went a little insane. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>You Are In Love - 8/10</b> <br> Aw this one's sweet. This song is like familiar but none of the lyrics- oohhh 
            wait yeah I recognize this. <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>New Romantics - 10/10</b> <br> Fantastic throwback. But also. Still
            holds up completely. Timeless. Amazing. <br>

          </p>
